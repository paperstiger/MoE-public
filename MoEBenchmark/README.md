# Study-All

In this folder, I will systematically study all the problems I have in the same framework.

I will let those data being where they were.

# data visualization

## show_dataset.py

Show existing dataset.

# generate clusters

## cluster_generation.py

A script to generate several clusters.

# evaluate clusters

## cluster_eval.py

Use metrics to indicate which metric truly reveals discontinuity.

# model training evaluating

## train_models.py

Train a model using data.

## train_hinton_moe.py

Train the MoE as Hinton talked on youtube.

## train_jacob_moe.py

Train MoE using Jacob log probability idea. It turns out to be pretty bad. But it encourage me to warm start it.

## train_mom_net.py

Train the MoM net directly using backpropagation directly.

## eval_models.py

Evaluate all models

# visualization of results

## draw_rollout_result_figures.py

Draw a figure showing all rollout results. This really saves space.

## gen_pen_model_cmp_fig.py

Generate figures comparing the pendulum problem.

# utility functions

## util.py

Yes, utility functions, as the name reveals.

## datanames.py

Record the data file for a few problem.

## delete_models.py

Some times you generate new models without removing old files.
